<h1>About Jazz Student Gigs</h1>

<p>
  Jazz Student Gigs is an informal, community-run contact point designed to help
  connect families of student jazz musicians with potential performance opportunities.
</p>

<p>
  This site does not represent any school, booster club, or nonprofit. It does not
  book gigs, negotiate terms, or participate in payment arrangements.
  Students and families decide independently whether to participate in any opportunity
  they are notified about.
